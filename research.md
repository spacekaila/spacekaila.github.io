# Research

My publications are listed on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Nathaniel%2C%20Kaila%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)/[ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2430-9515)/[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?searchtype=author&query=Nathaniel%2C+K).

## Graduate

### Rochester Institute of Technology
* I am working with Richard O'Shaughnessy to study compact binary remnants from isolated binary evolution. In particular, I am studying common envelope models and supernova recoil kicks using population synthesis and evolutionary models.

### University of Bonn
* For my thesis I worked with Norbert Langer to study massive single stars in the Milky Way. I used evolutionary models and population synthesis of single rotating stars at Galactic metallicity to investigate stellar spindown and envelope inflation in massive main sequence stars. I compared my results to a selection of stars from [The IACOB Project](http://research.iac.es/proyecto/iacob/pages/en/introduction.php), a long term spectroscopic study of Galactic OB stars. You can view my thesis [here](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/thesis/kaila-master.pdf).
* Before starting my thesis, I spent two semesters studying Wolf Rayet stars in both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds with Abel Schootemeijer. In the SMC, I was studying the parameters required for potential binary progenitors to WR stars traveling at unusually high speeds. For the LMC, I was focused on whether chemically homogeneous evolution could explain some observed LMC WR stars.

## Undergraduate
* At my home institution, Virginia Tech, I worked with John Simonetti to determine an upper limit on radio signal strength for the binary neutron star merger event that occured in August 2017. The (gigantic) paper, with over 3600 authors, can be seen [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa91c9/meta).

* I spent a winter break interning with ASRC Federal Space and Defense at NASA Goddard Flight Facility characterizing hardware for the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nancy-grace-roman-space-telescope) (then called WFIRST).

* I was selected for the Caltech LIGO SURF program and spent the summer working in Rana X. Adhikari's group with Brittany Kamai studying seismic metamaterials and their potential application to LIGO.

* I spent a summer at the University of Birmingham, UK working with Ilya Mandel (now at Monash University) on chemically homogeneous evolution. The work was published in MNRAS and can be viewed [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/505/1/663/6273653).
