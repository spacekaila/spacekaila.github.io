I love messages! I'm looking for a postdoc! Email me if you want to talk about jobs, space, academia, Germany, or a really good thriller you just read.

Undergrads: figuring out grad school, research, the dreaded application essays, and everything else that goes along with academia is difficult, confusing, and occasionally terrifying. At least, it was for me. I definitely don't know all the answers, but I'm happy to answer any and all questions, just email me.

email me at kjn9240 [AT] rit [DOT] edu
