# Workflow and tools
This is a collection of different tools and processes I use in daily life. I try to use free open source software (FOSS) when available, both for financial and philosophical reasons, but it's not always possible. None of this is an endorsement, just the tools that work for me. I use macOS, Linux, iOS, and Firefox, so I focus on those platforms.

*Information is accurate to the best of my knowledge at time of writing. Last updated May 2020.*

## Writing
### [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

Markdown editor designed to support general notetaking as well as function as a [Zettelkästen](https://zettelkasten.de/). It supports Markdown, LaTeX, tags, syntax highlighting, Zotero integration, light/dark modes, and exports to HTML, DOCX, ODT, and PDF. Zettlr doesn't mess with your files, so you can open and edit them in other programs and use cloud storage to sync the changes. I use [note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor) to add backlink functionality. This website was written in Zettlr.


### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
* Price: free with subscription options
* Open source: no
* Platforms: macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, Webclipper (Firefox, Chrome)

An all-in-one workspace that can hold almost anything and function as almost anything. Its main tools are notes/documents, knowledge bases, tasks/projects, and databases. Loads of keyboard shortcuts with /slash commands, uses Markdown formatting, has drag and drop, light/dark modes, and realtime collaboration. The free version (more like a free trial) includes 1,000 "blocks" (pieces of content, like a task or a database entry), and subscriptions start at $4/month. [Students and educators](https://www.notion.so/Notion-for-students-teachers-adc631df15ee4ab9a7a33dd50f4c16fe) can get the Personal plan (unlimited blocks, storage, and uploads) for free.

### [Goodnotes 5](https://www.goodnotes.com/)
* Price: $7.99
* Open source: no
* Platforms: macOS, iOS

Digital note taking app with seamless Apple Pencil support, OCR for PDFs and handwritten text, smart shapes, PDF import/annotation, images, textboxes, document tabs, and lots of export options. It syncs via iCloud and is a universal app, meaning buying the app on iOS unlocks it on macOS and vice versa. I use Goodnotes for all of my class and lecture notes.

### [Mini Diary](https://minidiary.app/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

Simple and secure journaling app. Everything is stored locally and encrypted with a password. If you store your journal file in the cloud, another computer with Mini Diary installed can decrypt the file if you enter the password. Easy import and export options. Has basic formatting, full-text search, statistics, and light/dark modes.

### [TexPad](https://www.texpad.com/)
* Price: $19.99
* Open source: no
* Platforms: macOS, iOS

Complete LaTeX environment for macOS and iOS with typesetting, a PDF viewer, and file syncing. You can download packages, typeset locally or in the cloud, and save locally or in the cloud. Features syntax highlighting, autocomplete, todos, document outlines, and more. I've only used the iOS version.

### [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

LaTeX editor with integrated PDF viewer, spell-check, autocomplete, code folding, unicode support, outlines, and more. Simple and easy to use. All my desktop LaTeX writing is done in Texmaker.

## Programming
### [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

Web-based development environment that allows you to create documents that contain executable code, text, images, equations, and more. Supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia. Share notebooks or export them as LaTeX or PDFs. I use Jupyter Lab for almost all my data science.

### [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

Text editor with thousands of packages to add features and functionality. It has smart autocomplete, syntax highlighting, a file system browser, multiple panes, find and replace, themes, and easy customization. Primarily intended for programming, but can be used for almost anything, thanks to the built-in package manager.

### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

Static site generator that takes Markdown files and generates HTML files based on layouts. Uses the Ruby Gems package manager. Supports both standalone pages and blogging functionality and has easy integration with GitHub pages. This site was created with Jekyll.

## Research
### [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
* Price: free with subscription options
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

Reference manager for collecting, organizing, citing, and sharing research. Combined with [zotfile](http://zotfile.com/) (manage attachments, sync between mobile, extract annotations) and [Better Bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) (manage bibliographic data for LaTeX) plugins, it can pretty much do anything (including sync with mobile PDF annotation apps). The free account includes 300 MB of storage with options to upgrade starting at $20/year, or you can sync your Zotero library with a cloud storage provider.

### [Papership](https://www.papershipapp.com/)
* Price: free with in app purchases
* Open source: no
* Platforms: macOS, iOS

Papership integrates with your Zotero and Mendeley account to help you annotate, manage, and share your papers. The annotation options ($10 in app purchase on iOS, recommended) include text highlighting, notes, and drawing, all compliant with the PDF standard, so you can see and extract your annotations in other apps. The iOS version has support for Apple Pencil. I generally read and annotate papers on my iPad with Papership and then extract the annotations in Zotero. I have only used the iOS version.

## Productivity
### [ClickUp](https://clickup.com?fp_ref=kaila34)
* Price: free with subscription options
* Open source: no
* Platforms: Web, macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire, Chrome extensions, email plugins (Gmail, Outlook), Amazon Alexa, Google Home

Project management app with features like statuses, subtasks, estimated task time, due dates and start dates, documents, realtime collaboration, assigning tasks, Google Calendar sync, integrations, and more. The free plan has 100 MB of storage and unlimited tasks and users. Subscriptions have more storage and project management features and start at $5/month. I haven't found any need to upgrade to a paid plan and I use it extensively for my personal life and research. I combine ClickUp with a bullet journal to keep myself organized. Full disclosure: the link above is a referral link and I will receive points if you use it.

### [Bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn)
* Price: cost of a notebook and pen
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: any

A methodology for organizing your personal planner with pen and paper. The classic bullet journal uses large overview spreads to view large spans of time, monthly spreads for a more focused overview, and daily rapid logging to capture day-to-day tasks and events. Instead of traditional planners, which have preprinted pages, bullet journals are designed to be flexible, with you creating pages as needed. I combine bullet journaling with digital tools by using a modified bullet journal (I have overviews, monthly, and weekly spreads and daily rapid logging) as a daily planner, while using ClickUp to manage my overall list of tasks and projects and ensure nothing is forgotten.

### [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/)
* Price: $9.99 with subscription options
* Open source: no
* Platforms: macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, Chromebook

Duet lets you use your mobile device as a second screen for your computer. It supports all iPhones, iPads, Chromebooks, and Android devices as second screens and all macOS and Windows computers as desktops. The basic version requires a wired connection and the subscriptions ($19.99/year and $29.99/year) provide more features such as wireless connection, remote desktop connection, and Apple Pencil support to use your iPad as a drawing tablet. So far, I haven't found a need for any of the subscription features.

## Focus and daily life
### [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS

Self Control blocks your access to websites, mail servers, or anything else on the internet. When the timer is running, nothing can disable it, not even restarting your computer or deleting the app. It has options for either a blacklist or a whitelist of sites.

### [Intention](https://www.getintention.com/)
* Price: free
* Open source: no
* Platforms: Firefox, Chrome

A browser extension that stops mindless browsing. When you open a distracting site, Intention shows you how long you've spent on distracting sites that day and asks for how long you'd like to unlock the site. After the timer is up, the site is blocked again unless you choose to unlock it.

### [Flora](https://flora.appfinca.com/)
* Price: free with in app purchases
* Open source: no
* Platforms: iOS

Focus app to help you put down your phone. When you start a focus session Flora plants a seed that will grow into a tree during the session. If you use your phone, however, the tree will die. Flora comes with a lot of collaborative features, so you can grow trees together with your friends, but you can use it solo as well. In app purchases allow you to sponsor the planting of real trees through the app's collaboration with [Trees.org](https://trees.org/sponsor/flora/).

## Misc
### [Awakee](https://awakee.me/)
* Price: free with in app purchase
* Open source: no
* Platforms: iOS

App for creating (and sticking to!) routines. You can use the smart routine scheduler and tell Awakee your desired habits and when you need to leave the house, or you can build your routine yourself. Once you start your routine, the timer function walks you through each step, and reminds you when it's time to switch tasks. Progress and habit tracking are integrated as well. The free version allows one routine, while the in app purchase ($1.99) unlocks multiple routines.

### [Stretchly](https://hovancik.net/stretchly/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

Stretchly reminds you to take breaks at your computer. The default behavior is to remind you to take a microbreak for 20 seconds every 10 minutes, and a 5 minute break every 30 minutes, but the timing is completely customizable.

### [Ferdi](https://getferdi.com/)
* Price: free
* Open source: yes
* Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows

A messaging browser that lets you combine messaging services into one app. Rather than having separate apps for WhatsApp, Slack, Messenger, etc., clogging up your dock, Ferdi packages them all together. Supports a huge range of services, including todo and reading apps.

### [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com)
* Price: free with subscription options
* Open source: no
* Platforms: macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, browser extensions (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Opera)

Password manager across devices with end-to-end encryption. You set one (very secure!) password on your LastPass vault and it stores all your passwords and sensitive data. It can automatically generate strong passwords with customizable criteria and the browser extensions can automatically save, update, and enter your login information. The free version has one-to-one sharing, while the subscription plans (starting at $3/month) let you share entries with multiple people, give more storage, and support emergency access options.
