# About me

<img src="/assets/Nathaniel-Kaila.JPG" alt="me" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="10" width="300px" />

I'm a Native Hawaiian scientist with a passion for stars. I was born and raised in the hustle and bustle of the DC area, moved to Appalachia for college, relocated to Germany for my MSc, then came back to the US for my PhD in Western NY. I love cities, green space, and the adventure of living around the world.

Other than research, I also love crunchy snacks, travel, yoga, running, reading, knitting, and making/appreciating all kinds of art. I learned German during my time abroad and nearly mastered German bureaucracy. I drink a lot of coffee and have strong opinions about the acceptable number of open tabs.

I've written a brief history below and I want to stress that none of this would have been possible without the support of mentors that believed in me and challenged me. Scientists don't work alone, we have help every step of the way. If any of the below sounds interesting, but you could use some help getting started, [let's work together](/contact.md) and see what we can find!
