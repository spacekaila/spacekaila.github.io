# About me

I'm a Native Hawaiian scientist with a passion for stars. I also love crunchy snacks, travel, reading, photography, knitting, and all kinds of art. I'm learning German, although not as fast as my landlord would like. I drink a lot of coffee and spend a lot of time at cafés.

I've written a brief history below, but I want to stress that none of this would have been possible without the support of mentors that believed in me and challenged me. If you're in high school or undergrad and any of the below sounds interesting, but you're not sure how to find similar opportunities in your area, [let's work together](contact.md) and see what we can find!
