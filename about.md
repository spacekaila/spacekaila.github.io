# About me

<img src="/assets/Nathaniel-Kaila.JPG" alt="me" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="10" width="300px" />

I'm a Native Hawaiian scientist with a passion for stars. I was born and raised in the hustle and bustle of the DC area, moved to Appalachia for college, relocated to Germany for my MSc, then came back to the US for my PhD in Western NY. I love cities, green space, and the adventure of living around the world.

Other than research, I also love crunchy snacks, travel, yoga, running, reading, knitting, and making/appreciating all kinds of art. I learned German during my time abroad and nearly mastered German bureaucracy. I drink a lot of coffee and have strong opinions about the acceptable number of open tabs.

I've written a brief list of resources and programs that have helped me along the way. Scientists don't work alone, and I am here doing science because of mentors that believe in me and challenge me. If you need some help getting started with any of the below, [let's work together](/contact.md) and see what we can find!


## Resources

* The [Virginia Space Grant Consortium](https://vsgc.odu.edu/) runs some really great programs for high school students, and has internship and scholarships for college students.
* Living Learning Communities can be a really great experience for undergraduate students. I really enjoyed my time in [Orion](https://llp.vt.edu/llc/orion.html) while at Virginia Tech.
* [Sigma Pi Sigma](https://www.sigmapisigma.org) is an honor society for physics students.
* [Research Experiences for Undergraduates](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu) are a wonderful way to get research experience outside of your home institution while an undergraduate. There are [similar programs](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf) not funded by the NSF as well (i.e., not always requiring US citizenship).
* [NASA internships](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/internship-programs/) are also a great way to get research experience (for undergraduate and graduate students).
* The [Honors branch](https://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/Webite_BCGS_2014/BCGS_Website/index/index.html#H2) of the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy is one of the few places you can get full funding as an MSc student in Europe.
* The [Kavli Summer Program in Astrophysics](https://kspa.soe.ucsc.edu/program) is similar to an REU, but for PhD students.
* The [LSSTC Data Science Fellowship](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/lincc/fellowship_program) has taught me a ton about data science, programming, and computational astrophysics.
