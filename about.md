# About me

<img src="/assets/portrait.jpg" alt="me" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50" width="300px" />

I'm a Native Hawaiian scientist with a passion for stars. I was born and raised in the hustle and bustle of the DC area, moved to Appalachia for college, and then relocated to Germany for graduate school. I love cities, green space, and the adventure (and occasional frustration) of expat life.

Other than research, I also love crunchy snacks, travel, yoga, running, reading, knitting, and making/appreciating all kinds of art. I'm learning German (and German bureaucracy!), although it's not going as fast as my landlord would like. I drink a lot of coffee and I love working at cafés (in pre-corona times).

I've written a brief history below and I want to stress that none of this would have been possible without the support of mentors that believed in me and challenged me. Scientists don't work alone, we have help every step of the way. If any of the below sounds interesting, but you could use some help getting started, [let's work together](/contact.md) and see what we can find!
