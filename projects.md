# coding projects

Here are some things I've made. No promises on usability or maintenance.

If you'd also like to make things, I recommend starting with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to get the basics. If you're a student, you can get a lot of resources through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

## [what are you doing? (wayd)](https://github.com/spacekaila/wayd)
A simple python script that uses `launchd` to pop up a box every 15 minutes asking what you're doing. The input and time is written to a markdown file. If a date-stamped file doesn't already exist, it creates a new file with a little template. You can keep the file open and add to it manually as well, giving you a daily rundown of what you did and what you thought about.
