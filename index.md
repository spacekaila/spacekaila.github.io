I am a first year MSc Honors student at the [Argelander Institute for Astronomy](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en) at the [University of Bonn](https://uni-bonn.de). In 2019 I completed my B.S. in physics at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu) in the [Physics Department](https://www.phys.vt.edu).

I work in theoretical astrophysics with a focus on high-energy phenomena and post-main sequence stellar evolution.
