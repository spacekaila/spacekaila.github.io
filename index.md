I'm looking for my next adventure! See my CV [here](cv.md) and email me [here](contact.md)!

I am a PhD candidate in [Astrophysical Sciences and Technology](https://www.rit.edu/study/astrophysical-sciences-and-technology-phd) at the [Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation](https://ccrg.rit.edu) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu). I work in Professor Richard O'Shaughnessy's [group](https://ccrgpages.rit.edu/~oshaughn/Richard_OShaughnessy/Home.html) studying massive stars using tools like [McFACTS](https://github.com/mcfacts) (and [here](https://saavikford.wixsite.com/saavik/general-7), I'm also one of the lead developers!), [COMPAS](https://compas.science), and [MESA](https://mesastar.org).

In 2022, I completed my MSc in Astrophysics at the [Argelander Institute for Astronomy](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en) at the [University of Bonn](https://uni-bonn.de) with Professor Norbert Langer, studying massive stellar spindown and envelope inflation. In 2019, I completed my BS in Physics at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu) in the [Physics Department](https://www.phys.vt.edu).
